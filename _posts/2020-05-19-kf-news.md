Dosh! Grab it while it's Hot!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folks! Today I'll be sharing a slightly deep-look into how I fixed and revived the 'News' tab with [KF-News-Fixer][news-fix]{:target="_blank"} and published it as a whitelisted fix.

# News Tab History

It's been so long since the news tab has been broken in-game, with a failed to reach host ugly message that serves no purpose at all. `TripWire` could have easily fixed this by literally just uploading or updating the news host, but I'm not quiet sure if they ever wanted that given that they've officially abandoned the game.

# What I Did

If you are familiar with [US (Unreal Script)][US]{:target="_blank"} Modding, you can simply view the code here in the [GitHub Repo][GitHubRepo]{:target="_blank"}.

For the others, UE2, or `Unreal Engine 2.5` is what KF1 is developed on. It's mostly extended classes from UT2K04, `Unreal Tournament 2004`, that changed most of the game aspects to what you see now; I never really was a modder or into modding before until i recently decided to give it a try. I have a coding background with several languages (My Job) and it was pretty straight forward on what to do.

`News Tab` is accessed via a UI button from the main menu. That made me start from `KFGUI.u`, which is the class where all the UI classes are extended then compiled into the said `.u`.

## Changing the starting HEX

All `.u` files start with a **`C2`** HeX like the following

<div align="center">
    <img width="650" height="" src="{{ site.url}}/assets/imgs/hex/hex1.png">
</div>
<br>

To view the contents of a `.u` with a [UnrealScript Explorer - Links][mega-zips]{:target="_blank"}, you will first need to change that **`C2`** to a **`C1`** so you can get the original file first. This can be done with a [Hex Editor][hex-editor]{:target="_blank"}

Result:

<div align="center">
    <img width="650" height="" src="{{ site.url}}/assets/imgs/hex/hex2.png">
</div>
<br>

You can then open the file with one of the ZIPs you downloaded from the link above.

**NOTE:** Don't forget to revert back to **`C2`** once you are done and want to recompile

## Decompiling

Once you viewed the code with an Explorer, you can go ahead and decompile it using **`UCC`** provided in your KF directory. To do so, navigate to your KF System folder and run the following command

```bash
ucc batchexport XXX.u class uc "D:\KF\XXX\Classes"
pause
```

Where `XXX` is the name of your .u file. This will decompile all .uc (Unreal Classes) into the directory you provided. In my case, I did all the work in:

`KFGui.u` ðŸ¡² `KFMOTD.uc` (out of many other .uc classes that were generated)

And added `GUIHTMLTextBox.uc` (Created by **Marco**) with my own fixes/Modifications to make it work with the News Tab.

If you would like to see my changed code just visit the **GitHub** repo above.

## Recompiling

Recompiling is pretty simple. Once you finish editing your code, create a new Directory under Killingfloor (where you have System, Engine etc.. ) with the name of your mutator/changed file. Inside this directory. create a `Classes` folder and put all your files inside.

Go to `KillingFloor.ini`and under `Editor.EditorEngine` at the *bottom* add 'EditPackages=XXX' where XXX is your changed file, then run the following in a CMD from your **System** folder:

```bash
ucc make
```

And you are DONE! If your changes are correctly extended/created you will see the name of your mutatr as successfully created.

If not, follow the errors in your terminal and see what you need to fix.

## WhiteListing

Whitelisting is a risky process, and is only applicable to changes you do on the **BASE GAME FILES** and not on files that are newly introduced to the game (e.g mutators or anything that is NOT downloaded when you installed the game)

To do so, you'll need to change the GUID of the file using:

- HeX editor provided above
- UT Explorer
- GUID Converted found here
- Brains ;D

The method is properly documented here in this [Guide by 'Psyche'][guid-fix]{:target="_blank"}
