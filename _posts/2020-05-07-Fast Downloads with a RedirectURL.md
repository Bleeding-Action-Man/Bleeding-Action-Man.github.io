&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very essential resource in **Killing floor** is a [RedirectURL][Redirect]{:target="_blank"} to host your *Compressed* mods and maps on.

The purpose of a redirectURL is to provide everyone a host where they can download your files from that server, with a substantialy increased speed than what the game can offer. Without it basically you cannot host a server that runs a lot of mods.

Today I'll be sharing my own RedirectURL with you, and a simple guide on how to set-up your own one!

## Usage

If you want to start using a RedirectURL, simply navigate to

>Killingfloor.ini

found in your **\System** directory of killing floor. Open it with a file editor and search `(Cntrl+F)` for `Redirect`, once found, simply enter the URL you want use; make sure you add a **`/`** (Back-Slash) at the end of the URL!

If you want to *Host*, all the compression, upload, account creation and usage as well is in the guide above!
