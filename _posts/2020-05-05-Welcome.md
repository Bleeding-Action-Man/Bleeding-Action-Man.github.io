Hello there, fresh meat!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a way to keep track of all my work and contributions to [Killing Floor][KF]{:target="_blank"}, I've decided to create a blog-like site where I upload articels about new things I've either:

- Created
- Documented
- Found

<br>
<hr>
<br>

## What will these articles include, mainly?

Well, I usually create Killing Floor [Guides][Guides]{:target="_blank"}, and recently i've been reviving long lost [Mutators][Mutators]{:target="_blank"} and adding them to the [Workshop][WS]{:target="_blank"}. So you can expect any kind of update to guides, mutators, maps, people, groups, clans etc.. to be published here.

Along that, I will be helping new players hop back into KF-1! How cool is that?

<br>

So, I hope you find what you're looking for here & Enjoy the stay!
